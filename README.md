#### Daily WarHammer40K quote

```
There is no truth in flesh, only betrayal.
There is no strength in flesh, only weakness.
There is no constancy in flesh, only decay.
There is no certainty in flesh but death.

In the Machine, we find truth.
In the Machine, we find strength.
In the Machine, we find immortality.

â€” The Credo Omnissiah, Litany of the Adeptus Mechanicus

```
